Airflow acts as the **control plane** for the entire data platform, coordinating compute, storage, and analytics layers reliably.


# Data Modeling Strategy
This document explains the analytical data model designed in Snowflake.

## 1. Modeling Approach
- Dimensional modeling (Star Schema)
- Clear separation of facts and dimensions
- Optimized for analytical queries


## 2. Fact Tables

### Fact: \`fact_claims\`

**Grain**
> One row per insurance claim

| Column | Description |
|-----|-----------|
| claim_id | Unique claim identifier |
| member_id | Foreign key to dim_members |
| provider_id | Foreign key to dim_providers |
| claim_date | Date of claim |
| amount | Billed amount |
| paid_amt | Paid amount |
| status | Claim status |
| ingestion_ts | Load timestamp |

Purpose:

- Cost analysis
- Claims volume
- Payment ratios
- Trend reporting


## 3. Dimension Tables

### Dimension: \`dim_members\`
- member_id (PK)
- name
- age
- gender
- location

### Dimension: \`dim_providers\`

- provider_id (PK)
- name
- specialty
- city

## 4. Slowly Changing Dimensions

- Managed via dbt snapshots
- Type 2 SCD
- Tracks historical attribute changes

## 5. Modeling Principles

- Surrogate keys avoided for simplicity
- Business keys preserved
- Facts kept narrow
- Dimensions denormalized for performance

## 6. Analytics Use Cases Enabled

- Claims cost analysis
- Provider performance
- Member utilization trends
- Time-series reporting

## 7. Summary

The data model is designed to be:
- Easy to query
- BI-friendly
- Scalable
- Aligned with real healthcare analytics workloads
